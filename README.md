# Examples of Simulations of Nanometric Systems 
Here we provide some illustrative examples for the [SSN](https://guies.uab.cat/guies_docents/public/portal/html/2025/assignatura/103304/ca) course at UAB.
The videos include:
- Melting of ice (as an example of thermodynamic transformation)
- Protein adsorption over a nanoparticle (bio-nano)
- Double slit experiment (as an example of quantum phenomena)
